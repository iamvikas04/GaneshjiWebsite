      Lord Ganesh, also known as Vinayaka, Gajanand or Chaturbhuj among his 108 names is considered to be the God of new beginnings. 
      It is in the honour of his birth that the country celebrates Ganesh Chaturthi. 
      Lord Ganesha is praised as the God of wisdom, prosperity, good fortune and the destroyer of evils, for which he earns a special name, as 'Vignaharta'.
      Ganesh Chaturthi falls annually in the sixth month of Hindu calendar, Bhadrapada, which generally falls in August or September. 
      This year, the festival will be celebrated on Saturday, August 22.

      Ganesh Chaturthi is a celebration which holds a lot of significance for devotees. 
      Worshippers bring home an idol of Lord Ganesha every year, welcoming him as their guest and worship him for ten days, after which, he is bid goodbye, which is known as Visarjan. 
      Special pujas and aartis are organized on all ten days. 
      Huge statues of the deity are also installed in public spaces to mark the festival. Special offerings and delicacies such as modak, which is considered to be Lord Ganesha's favourites are prepared during the festival.
      Homes are decorated, people visit each other and offer their blessings. However, this year, the pandemic has muted down the festivity, which otherwise, always happens in a grand manner.
